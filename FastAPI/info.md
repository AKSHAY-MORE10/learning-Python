# FastAPI Overview üöÄ

## What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with **Python 3.7+** based on standard **Python type hints**. It is built on top of **Starlette** for the web parts and **Pydantic** for data validation.

---

## Why Use FastAPI in Real-World Applications?

FastAPI is widely used for building:

- **REST APIs** and **microservices**
- **Machine Learning model deployment**
- **Web applications backends**
- **IoT** and **mobile app** backends
- **Internal tooling APIs**
- **Chatbots and automation systems**

### Real-World Use Cases:

- **Netflix** uses FastAPI for some of its internal tools.
- **Microsoft** has used FastAPI for production-grade services.
- **Uber** uses FastAPI for building performant microservices.
- Developers often use FastAPI with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD** pipelines for robust deployments.

## Other Important Features

- **Auto Documentation** with Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`)
- **Dependency Injection System** for reusability
- **Security & Authentication** support
- **Asynchronous support** using `async def` for high performance

## Advantages of FastAPI

‚úÖ Super fast performance (comparable to NodeJS and Go)  
‚úÖ Automatic validation and type checking  
‚úÖ Developer-friendly with automatic docs  
‚úÖ Easy to integrate with databases like SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, etc.  
‚úÖ Great for async and concurrent code

## Final Thoughts

FastAPI is **perfect for building scalable and modern APIs**. It‚Äôs easy to learn, fast to develop with, and robust enough for production. Whether you're building a small hobby project or an enterprise-grade system, FastAPI is an excellent choice.

## Core Features / Functions in FastAPI

### 1. Creating the App

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# Saving the provided markdown content with a proper structure to a markdown file

proper_path_md = """# Using `Path()` in FastAPI üìç

## What is `Path()`?

In **FastAPI**, the `Path()` function is used to declare **required path parameters** and to apply **metadata or validation rules** to them. It's especially useful when you want to ensure the values passed through the URL meet certain criteria.

## Syntax

```python
from fastapi import Path

def endpoint_name(param_name: type = Path(...)):
    pass
